Django app to manage Canadian taxes in Satchmo.

Adapted from the version created by Benoit C. Sirois:
http://bitbucket.org/benoitcsirois/satchmo-canadian-tax

You need to add the CanadianTaxRate model and then add the following data to it in the Django admin:

Tax Class, Tax Zone, Tax Country, Display percentage, Enter your tax number here
Default, None, Canada, 5.00%, GST
Default, Quebec, None, 7.50%, QST

Make sure you set the compound order appropriately. Now you can apply tax to products shipped to Quebec (GST and QST) and apply GST only to those shipped to Canada.

Note: If you want to tax shipping costs then you will probably have to modify some code.
